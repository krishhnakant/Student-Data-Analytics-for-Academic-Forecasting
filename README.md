# Student-Data-Analytics-for-Academic-Forecasting
This project predicts student final grades using a linear regression model based on factors like study hours, attendance, and past performance. It helps identify at-risk students for early academic intervention.

Project: Student Performance Prediction
=======================================

Overview:
---------
This project aims to forecast student academic performance using supervised machine learning. The model is trained using attributes such as hours studied, attendance rate, assignment scores, and previous grades.

Files Included:
---------------
1. student_performance.csv       --> Dataset used for training and testing
2. student_grade_prediction.py   --> Python script to train and evaluate a prediction model
3. README.txt                    --> Project summary and usage guide
4. Documentation.txt             --> Detailed explanation of the project methodology

How to Run:
-----------
1. Ensure Python is installed (preferably 3.7+)
2. Install required packages:
   pip install pandas scikit-learn

3. Run the prediction script:
   python student_grade_prediction.py

Output:
-------
- Mean Squared Error (MSE) to evaluate prediction accuracy
- Feature importance coefficients to understand predictor influence

Use Cases:
----------
✔ Academic forecasting
✔ Early intervention systems
✔ Educational analytics
